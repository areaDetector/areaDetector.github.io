Overview
--------

This plugin accepts 1-D arrays of dimension [NumSignals] or 2-D arrays
of dimension [NumSignals, NewTimePoints]. The plugin creates NumSignals
NDArrays of dimension [NumTimePoints], each of which is the time-series
for one signal. It also creates an NDArray of dimension [NumTimePoints,
NumSignals] containing the data for all of the signals. It also exports
waveform records containing the time-series data for each signal, and a
time-axis array containing the relative times of each point in the
time-series. These waveform records are useful for plotting in OPI
screens.

On each callback the new time points are appended to the existing time
series arrays. The plugin can operate either two modes. In fixed time
mode the time-series arrays are cleared when acquisition is started, and
new time points are appended until NumTimePoints points have been
received, at which point acquisition stops and further callbacks are
ignored. In circular buffer mode once NumTimePoints samples are received
then acquisition continues with the new time points replacing the oldest
ones in the circular buffer.

The plugin requires knowing the time interval between samples from the
driver (TimePerPoint). This information normally comes from a database
link to a record in the detector driver, but it can be manually
specified as well. The plugin exports a 1-D waveform record containing
the relative time values of each sample, which can be used for the
horizontal axis in an OPI display.

The plugin optionally does time averaging of the input signal. It can
average any integer number of input samples(NumAverage), so that the
time between points in the output waveforms is NumAverage*TimePerPoint =
AveragingTime.

NDPluginTimeSeries inherits from NDPluginDriver. The `NDPluginTimeSeries
class
documentation <../areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/class_n_d_plugin_time_series.html>`__
describes this class in detail.

Several database template files are provided:

NDPluginTimeSeries inherits from NDPluginDriver.

NDPluginTimeSeries defines the following parameters. It also implements
all of the standard plugin parameters from
:doc:`NDPluginDriver`. The template files
listed above provide access to these parameters, listed in the following
tables.

Configuration
-------------

The NDPluginTimeSeries plugin is created with the ``NDTimeSeriesConfigure``
function, either from C/C++ or from the EPICS IOC shell.

::

   NDTimeSeriesConfigure(const char *portName, int queueSize, int blockingCallbacks, 
                             const char *NDArrayPort, int NDArrayAddr, int maxSignals,
                             int maxBuffers,  size_t maxMemory, int priority, int stackSize)
     

All but the ``maxSignals`` parameter are common to all plugins.

maxSignals defines how many signals this plugin will deal with. Usually
this will match the number of NDTimeSeriesN templates have been loaded.

For example:

::

    NDTimeSeriesConfigure("TS1", 100, 0, "DET1", 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0)
