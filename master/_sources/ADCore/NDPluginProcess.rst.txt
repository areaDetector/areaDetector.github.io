Overview
--------

NDPluginProcess performs arithmetic processing on NDArray data. It
performs the following operations in the order listed. Each of these
operations can be individually enabled and disabled.

- Subtracts a background array which has been previously acquired.
- Divides by a flat field array which has been previously acquired, and
- then multiplies by a flat field scale factor.
- Multiplies by a scale factor and adds an offset.
- Clips to a maximum specified value.
- Clips to a minimum specified value.
- Applies a recursive digital filter.
- Converts to the specified output data type.
- Exports the processed data as a new NDArray object.

If any of the above operations is enabled, then the array is first
converted to NDFloat64 data type, i.e. double-precision float. The
operations are all performed in double-precision, and then the array is
converted to the specified output data type.

NDPluginProcess is both a **recipient** of callbacks and a **source** of
NDArray callbacks. This means that other plugins, such the
NDPluginStdArrays, NDPluginStats, and NDPluginFile plugins can be
connected to an NDPluginProcess plugin, in which case they will use the
processed data.

NDPluginProcess is fully N-dimensional. It can be used for 2-D images,
3-D (color) images, or any type of N-dimensional data.

NDPluginProcess inherits from NDPluginDriver. The `NDPluginProcess class
documentation <../areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/class_n_d_plugin_process.html>`__
describes this class in detail.

NDPluginProcess.h defines the following parameters. It also implements
all of the standard plugin parameters from
`NDPluginDriver <pluginDoc.html#NDPluginDriver>`__. The EPICS database
NDProcess.template provide access to these parameters, listed in the
following table. Note that to reduce the width of this table the
parameter index variable names have been split into 2 lines, but these
are just a single name, for example ``NDPluginProcessSaveBackground``.

          This is a convenience sseq record to simplify reading the background array from
          a TIFF file. Prior to processing this record the $(P)$(R)TIFF: plugin records must
          be correctly configured to read the desired background TIFF file. Processing this

            <li>Enables ArrayCallbacks for the TIFF plugin in case they were not enabled.</li>
            <li>Writes 1 to $(R)$(P)TIFF:ReadFile. This causes the TIFF plugin to read the selected
              file, do callbacks to the Process plugin.</li>

          Processing this record will enable Offset and Scale calculations, and set the Offset=-min(Array)
          and Scale=MaxScale/(max(Array)-min(Array)), where MaxScale is the maximum value
          of the output data type. The output array will thus be scaled to completely fill
          the range of the output data type. Note that the calculation of the offset and scale
          factors is only done once when this record is processed, and these values are used
          for subsequent array callbacks, i.e. it does not autoscale on each array callback.
          Thanks to Tom Cobb for this addition.

          Choices are "Every array" and "Array N only". If "Every array" is selected then
          the plugin does callbacks for every incoming array it receives. If "Array N only"
          is selected then the plugin only does callbacks when NumFiltered=NumFilter. This
          can be very useful when using the Sum or Average filter modes. Callbacks are then
          done only when N sums or averages have been performed. If used with AutoResetFilter
          then as input arrays arrive the plugin will continually output one summed or averaged
          array after every N incoming arrays.

Recursive filter implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The recursive filter performs filtering in the time (not spatial)
domain. It is implemented in a fairly general manner, so that a variety
of filters can be implemented. These include integrating filters and
differentiating filter types. The recursive filter stores one "filter"
array internally. Using this internal filter array, and a new input
array, it computes an output array, and a new version of the filter
array. The equations governing the output array and new filter array
are:

::

   O[n] = OOffset + OScale*((OC1 + OC2/N)*F[n-1] +
                            (OC3 + OC4/N)*I[n])
   F[n] = FOffset + FScale*((FC1 + FC2/N)*F[n-1] +
                            (FC3 + FC4/N)*I[n])
   On filter reset
   F[0] = ROffset + RC1*F[0] + RC2*I[0] 
     
   where
     I[n] = New input array from callback
     I[0] = First input array after a filter reset
   F[n-1] = Stored filter array
     F[n] = New filter array
     F[0] = Current filter array when filter is reset.  
            May be a copy of I[0] if there was no valid filter array.
        N = Current value of NumFiltered
     O[n] = Output array passed to clients

Predefined filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The NDProcess.template database implements the following predefined
filters using the ``$(P)$(R)FilterType`` record. The implementation of these
predefined filter types is done entirely in the database, not in the
plugin code. The database simply downloads values of OC1-OC4, FC1-FC4,
and RC1-RC2 that result in predefined filter behaviours. The operation
of the recursive filter is by no means limited to these fixed filter
types, they are simply provided as a convenience, and can be easily
modified or extended. Note that the database does not download values of
OOffset, OScale, FOffset, FScale, or ROffset, so these remain unchanged
when a new filter is selected. The equations below do not include these
offset and scale values, but they are useful in many circumstances.

The ``NDProcess_settings.req`` file for save/restore saves the values of all
of the filter coefficients, and downloads them when EPICS initialized at
iocInit. It also saves the FilterType, but does not process this record
at iocInit, so that any customized filter coefficients will be
preserved, and will not be replaced by the defaults for that filter
type.

Recursive Average
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The recursive average filter does input array averaging. It is defined
as:

::

   O[n] = F[n] = (1-1/N)*F[n-1] + 1/N*I[n]

N is the characteristic number of arrays in the average. For example, if
N=100, then each new array is weighted by 0.01 and the previous filter
value is weighted by 0.99. This is an infinite impulse response (IIR)
filter, because the effect of one array never complelely dissappears,
but rather decays exponentially. When this filter is reset the filter
array is initialized with the first input array. This filter can be used
to decrease the noise and increase the dynamic range of a repetitive
input signal with a small signal. In that case it can be useful to use
set EnableOffsetScale=Enable and set Scale to a large enough number to
more fully use the dynamic range of the output data type. The averaged
signal will then better use the dynamic range of the output data type.

Average
^^^^^^^

The average filter does input array averaging. It is defined as:

::

   O[n] = F[n] = F[n-1] + 1/N*I[n]

N is the number of arrays in the average. For example, if N=100, then
each new array is weighted by 0.01. When this filter is reset the filter
array is initialized to 0. This filter typically cannot be run forever,
because the output grows monotonically and will lead to overflow.
However, if AutoResetFilter is enabled then the filter will be reset
when NumFiltered=NumFilter. If ArrayCallbacks is "Array N only" then
callbacks will be done only with the final averaged value.

Sum
^^^

The sum filter does input array summing. It is defined as:

::

   O[n] = F[n] = F[n-1] + I[n]

This filter simply computes the sum of input arrays. When this filter is
reset the filter array is initialized to 0. It is often necessary to set
the output data type to one with a larger maximum value than the input
array to prevent overflow. If AutoResetFilter is enabled then the filter
will be reset when NumFiltered=NumFilter. If ArrayCallbacks is "Array N
only" then callbacks will be done only with the final summed value.

Difference
^^^^^^^^^^

The difference filter computes the difference between frame N and frame
N-1. It is defined as:

::

   O[n] = -F[n-1] + I[n]
   F[n] = I[n]

Note that the difference will often be a small signed number. If the
output datatype is unsigned, or if a display client expects unsigned
numbers, then it can be useful to set OOffset to a non-zero value to add
an offset to the result. For example, if the output data type is UInt8
(unsigned 8-bit), then setting OOffset to 128 will produce an unsigned
image centered at 128. Similarly OScale can be used to increase the
range of the difference by multiplying by a factor greater than 1,
although this will not increase the dynamic range of the result, only
the absolute range.

Recursive Average Difference
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This filter computes the difference between frame N and the recursive
average of previous frames. It is a combination of the Difference and
Recursive Average filters described above. The new filter is a recursive
average, but the output is the difference between the current frame and
that recursive average. It is defined as:

::

   O[n] = -F[n-1] + I[n]
   F[n] = (1-1/N)*F[n-1] + 1/N*I[n]

N is again the characteristic number of arrays in the average.

Copy to Filter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This filter simply copies the input array to the filter array and the
output array. It is defined as:

::

   O[n] = F[n] = I[n]

This filter can be used to load the filter (F) with a certain array,
which is then subsequently used for some other filter type.

Configuration
-------------

The NDPluginProcess plugin is created with the NDProcessConfigure
command, either from C/C++ or from the EPICS IOC shell.

::

   NDProcessConfigure(const char *portName, int queueSize, int blockingCallbacks,
                      const char *NDArrayPort, int NDArrayAddr,
                      int maxBuffers, size_t maxMemory,
                      int priority, int stackSize)
     

For details on the meaning of the parameters to this function refer to
the detailed documentation on the NDProcessConfigure function in the
`NDPluginProcess.cpp
documentation <../areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/_n_d_plugin_process_8cpp.html>`__
and in the documentation for the constructor for the `NDPluginProcess
class <../areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/class_n_d_plugin_process.html>`__.

Screen shots
------------

The following is the MEDM screen that provides access to the parameters
in ``NDPluginDriver.h`` and ``NDPluginProcess.h`` through records in
``NDPluginBase.template`` and ``NDProcess.template``. In this example the input
image is first offset by -4 and scaled by 35. That result is then
clipped to a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 255. The image is then run
through a recursive averaging filter with N=100.

The following is the MEDM screen for reading a background image or
flatfield image from a TIFF file. It is a stripped-down version of the
normal TIFF plugin screen, and allows specifying the path and filename
components to construct the full filename.

.. image:: NDProcessTIFF.png
    :align: center


Image collected with 30 microsecond exposure time, so it is very noisy.
This is the image output from the NDPlugProcess plugin with Offset and
Scale as shown above, but with the recursive filter disabled.

.. image:: NDProcess_unfiltered.jpg
    :align: center


NDPluginStats plugin connected to the NDPluginProcess filter for the
noisy image above. Note that there are only 6 non-zero intensities in
the histogram, because the brightest pixels are only 6 A/D units above
background.

.. image:: NDStats_unfiltered.png
    :align: center

Same image collected with 30 microsecond exposure time. This is the
image output from the NDPlugProcess plugin with Offset and Scale as
shown above, with the recursive filter enabled. Note the dramatic
improvement in signal to noise.

    :align: center


NDPluginStats plugin connected to the NDPluginProcess filter for the
filtered image above. Note that there are many non-zero intensities in
the histogram, because the filtering is improving the dynamic range
significantly.
