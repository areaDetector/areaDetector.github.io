Overview
--------

NDPosPlugin can be used to attach positional information to NDArrays in
the form of NDAttributes. This plugin accepts an XML description of the
position data and then attaches each position to NDArrays as they are
passed through the plugin. Each position can contain a set of index
values and each index is attached as a separate NDAttribute. The plugin
operates using a FIFO and new positions can be added to the queue while
the plugin is actively attaching position data. When used in conjunction
with the HDF5 writer (:doc:`NDFileHDF5`) it is possible
to store NDArrays in an arbitrary pattern within a multi-dimensional
dataset.

The NDPosPlugin plugin is created with the ``NDPosPluginConfigure`` command,
either from C/C++ or from the EPICS IOC shell.

.. code-block:: c

   NDPosPluginConfigure (const char *portName, int queueSize, int blockingCallbacks, 
                        const char *NDArrayPort, int NDArrayAddr, size_t maxMemory, 
                        int priority, int stackSize)
     

For details on the meaning of the parameters to this function refer to
the detailed documentation on the NDPosPluginConfigure function in the
`NDPosPlugin.cpp
documentation <../areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/_n_d_file_h_d_f5_8cpp.html>`__
and in the documentation for the constructor for the `NDPosPlugin
class <../areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/class_n_d_file_h_d_f5.html>`__.

XML Defined Positions
---------------------

The position data is supplied to the plugin as an XML description. The
parameter **NDPos_Filename** can either accept the full path to an XML
file with the position data description, or the XML can be injected
directly into the parameter. There is a 1,000,000 byte limit on the
parameter, but multiple injections can take place in sequence with each
set of points appended to the FIFO.

The XML definition contains the following 4 main elements: dimensions,
dimension, positions, and position.

-  **dimensions:** Contains the dimension elements that provide the
   dimension name definitions
-  **dimension:** The name of a dimension. This name is used for the
   NDAttribute name that is attached to the NDArray with position
   information.
-  **positions:** Contains the position elements.
-  **position:** Represent a single position to be added to the FIFO.

The XML can contain any number of dimension elements (grouped within the
dimensions element), and each dimension must contain a single attribute
**name** that names the particular dimension. Once the dimensions have
been defined, the position elements are added. The XML can contain any
number of position elements (grouped within the positions element). Each
position element should have an attribute for each of the named
dimensions with the value of the position for that dimension. An example
of a simple XML description is presented below:

.. code-block:: xml

   <pos_layout>
       <dimensions>
           <dimension name="x"></dimension>
           <dimension name="y"></dimension>
           <dimension name="z"></dimension>
       </dimensions>
       <positions>
           <position x="0" y="0" z="0"></position>
           <position x="0" y="0" z="1"></position>
           <position x="0" y="1" z="0"></position>
           <position x="0" y="1" z="1"></position>
           <position x="1" y="0" z="0"></position>
           <position x="1" y="0" z="1"></position>
           <position x="1" y="1" z="0"></position>
           <position x="1" y="1" z="1"></position>
       </positions>
   </pos_layout>

In the example above, three dimensions have been defined (x, y and z).
The positions are then defined with value for each dimension provided.
This XML description will result in three NDAttriubtes being attached to
each NDArray, with the names x, y and z respectively. The value of each
of the NDAttributes will be set according to the position that is
currently at the front of the FIFO.

A complete example XML layout file is provided in
"ADCore/iocBoot/pos_plugin_demo.xml".

An XML schema is provided in "ADCore/iocBoot/pos_plugin_schema.xsd". The
schema defines the syntax that is allowed in the user's XML definition.
It can also be used with the 'xmllint' command to validate a user's XML
definition:

::

   xmllint --noout --schema ADCore/iocBoot/pos_plugin_schema.xsd /path/to/users/layout.xml

Using the plugin
----------------

The plugin offers two modes of operation: **Discard** and **Keep**. When
executed in discard mode the plugin will throw away a position every
time it is attached to an NDArray, and the FIFO will continue to
decrease in size until it reaches zero. When executed in Keep mode the
positions will still be sent in order but they will not be discarded. A
parameter can be used to reset the current position to the start and
then the same set can be reused. The position attachment can be started
and stopped, and the FIFO can be cleared. A record of the number of
positions in the FIFO, the current index and a string representation of
the last position sent are provided through the parameter interface.

Frame Identification tracking
-----------------------------

The plugin tracks frame information to ensure that the incoming frames
are in the correct order and there are no missing or duplicated frames.
This is achieved using three parameters, **IDName**, **IDStart** and
**IDDifference**. The IDName tells the plugin which incoming attribute
to use as the ID to track, or if it is left empty then the uniqueId
member variable of the NDArray is used. The IDStart value informs this
plugin of the first expected ID when the acquisition is started, and the
IDDifference informs this plugin of the expected delta ID between each
frame. An IDStart of 5 and IDDifference of 10 would result in the plugin
expecting the following sequence of ID values attached to the incoming
frames: 5,15,25,35... If incoming frames contain IDs that are greater
than the expected ID then the plugin will print a warning and throw away
any position information up until the expected ID matches the frame ID;
this is a case where the frames are assumed to have been dropped. If
incoming frames contain IDs that are less than the exptected ID then the
plugin will print an error and drop the frames until the incoming frame
ID matches the expected ID. This is a more serious case of the plugin
dropping frames and this is why the error is printed. In both of these
error situations the plugin will record the event into the corresponding
counter and continue to process frames.
