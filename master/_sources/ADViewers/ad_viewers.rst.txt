Overview
--------

One of the advantages of areaDetector is that it enables the use of
generic image display clients that obtain their data via EPICS Channel
Access or pvAccess and work with any detector. There are currently three
such generic clients provided with the areaDetector distribution. The
first two are plugins for the popular ImageJ Java-based image processing
program. ``EPICS_AD_Viewer.java`` uses EPICS Channel Access, while
``EPICS_NTNDA_Viewer.java`` uses EPICS V4 pvAccess. The third is an
IDL-based viewer which can be run without an IDL license under the IDL
Virtual Machine. Because ImageJ is free and more widely available and
used than IDL, future enhancements are more likely to be done on the
ImageJ plugins rather than the IDL viewer. These viewers are contained
in the areaDetector distribution in the `ADViewers
repository <https://github.com/areaDetector/ADViewers>`__

In addition to the ImageJ viewer plugins, there is an ImageJ plugin to
graphically define the detector/camera readout region, ROIs, and
overlays (``EPICS_AD_Controller.java``). Another ImageJ plugin provided with
areaDetector does realtime line profiles with Gaussian peak fitting
(``GaussianProfile.java``).

ImageJ Viewers
--------------

These are plugin for the popular `ImageJ <http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/>`__
program that can be used to display 2-dimensional array data. Both of
these plugins were originally written by Tim Madden from APS. Both
support all NDArray data types and color modes, i.e. Mono, RGB1 (pixel
interleave), RGB2 (row interleave) and RGB3 (plane interleave). The
plugin directory also includes a plugin written elsewhere for reading
and writing netCDF files, so ImageJ can be used to display images and
image sequences (movies) saved with the NDFileNetCDF plugin.

EPICS_AD_Viewer.java
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This plugin uses EPICS Channel Access to display images via waveform
records that the :doc:`../ADCore/NDPluginStdArrays` sends
to EPICS.

EPICS_NTNDA_Viewer.java
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This plugin uses EPICS V4 pvAccess to display NTNDArrays that the
:doc:`../ADCore/NDPluginPva` sends to EPICS. The
EPICS_NTNDA_Viewer has a number of significant advantages compared to
the EPICS_AD_Viewer:

-  The NTNDArray data is transmitted "atomically" over the network,
   rather than using separate PVs for the image data and the metadata
   (image dimensions, color mode, etc.)
-  NTNDArrays and pvAccess support sending compressed arrays over the
   network. Beginning with ADViewers R1-3 the EPICS_NTNDA_Viewer can
   decompress the NTNDArrays and display them. This can significantly
   reduce the required network bandwith when the IOC and the viewer are
   running on different machines.
-  When using Channel Access the data type of the waveform record is
   fixed at iocInit, and cannot be changed at runtime. This means, for
   example, that if the user might want to view both 8-bit images,
   16-bit images, and 64-bit double FFT images then the waveform record
   would need to be 64-bit double, which adds a factor of 8 network
   overhead when viewing 8-bit images. pvAccess changes the data type of
   the NTNDArrays dynamically at run-time, removing this restriction.
-  Channel Access requires setting ``EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES``, which is a
   source of considerable confusion and frustration for users. pvAccess
   does not use ``EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES`` and there is no restriction on
   the size of the NTNDArrays.
-  The performance using pvAccess is significantly better than using
   Channel Access. NDPluginPva is 5-10 times faster than
   NDPluginStdArrays, and ImageJ can display 1.5-2 times more images/s
   with pvAccess than with Channel Access.

To use these ImageJ plugins do the following:

-  Install ImageJ from `ImageJ download
   site <https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html>`__. If installing on
   Windows I recommend installing the version bundled with Java 1.8.
-  Copy the entire directory ADViewers/ImageJ/EPICS_areaDetector to
   the plugins/ directory in the ImageJ installation location. On OS X
   this can be done with the command:

   ::

          cp -r Viewers/ImageJ/EPICS_areaDetector /Applications/ImageJ/plugins
            

-  The ImageJ plugins are supplied as Java source code, so you will need
   to compile the Java code. This can be done in the ImageJ
   Plugins/Compile and Run menu. Browse for the appropriate source file
   (``EPICS_AD_Viewer.java``, ``EPICS_NTNDA_Viewer.java``, etc.) to compile and
   run it. The compilation step only needs to be done once, creating the
   required .class files.
-  For the EPICS_NTNDA_Viewer to decompress arrays these additional
   steps are required:

   -  The decompression is done using the C libraries because there does
      not appear to be native Java code for blosc decompression, and the
      native Java code for jpeg decompression is signifcantly more
      complicated (and probably slower) than just using the C library.
      The required libraries on Linux are ``decompressJPEG.so``,``libjpeg.so``,
      ``libblosc.so``, and ``libzlib.so``. On Windows the libraries are
      ``decompressJPEG.dll``, ``jpeg.dll``, ``blosc.dll``, and ``zlib.dll``.
   -  These libraries can all be built as part of
      ``areaDetector/ADSupport``, and this is recommended. If the ImageJ
      viewers are being installed at a location which is not building
      ADSupport then pre-built versions of the ADSupport libraries are
      available at
      `cars.uchicago.edu/software/pub/ADSupport <https://cars.uchicago.edu/software/pub/ADSupport>`__.
      Both tar and zip files are available there.
   -  ImageJ needs to be able to find these shareable libraries to
      handle compressed arrays. One way to do this is to add
      ``[YOUR_LOCATION]areaDetector/ADSupport/lib/linux-x86_64/`` to the
      ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` environment variable on Linux, and
      ``[YOUR_LOCATION]areaDetector/ADSupport/lib/windows-x86`` to the ``PATH``
      environment variable on Windows. This assumes that ADSupport was
      built using ``WITH_BLOSC=YES``, ``WITH_JPEG=YES``, ``BLOSC_EXTERNAL=NO``, and
      ``JPEG_EXTERNAL=NO``.
   -  In principle another way to do this is to set the jna.library.path
      property to point to that directory when starting ImageJ, e.g.

      ::

        java -Djna.library.path=/home/epics/support/areaDetector/ADSupport/lib/linux-x86_64 -jar ij.jar

      However, ImageJ is normally started via an executable file rather
      than a script invoking ``ij.jar`` on both Linux and Windows, and
      loading via the above command requires other settings as well to
      make ImageJ work properly.
   -  The ADViewers distribution includes two new jar files,
      ``jna-5.1.0.jar`` and ``jblosc-1.0.1.dev.jar``. The jna file provides
      support for Java Native Access, which is the interface to calling
      the shareable libraries. The jblosc file provides a Java wrapper
      around the blosc shareable library. These files need to be copied
      to ``ImageJ/plugins/EPICS_areaDetector`` along with the other files in
      the ``ADViewers/ImageJ/EPICS_areaDetector`` directory.
   -  The ADViewers distribution also includes two new .java files,
      ``decompressJPEGDll.java`` and ``myUtil.java``. These files need to be
      compiled once in ImageJ using the \`Plugins/Compile and Run ...\`
      menu. The files are actually just compiled and not run, since they
      are just support files, not plugins. ``decompressJPEGDll.java`` is a
      wrapper around the C JPEG library. ``myUtil.java`` is a modified
      version of ``Util.java`` that is included in the JBlosc package. The
      version in that package lacked support for short (16-bit integer)
      arrays, and lacked the ability to specify the byte order for JNA
      buffers.

-  The ImageJ viewers use the pure-Java libraries for EPICS Channel
   Access and pvAccess. This means that unlike the IDL Viewer, no
   C-based shareable-libraries or DLLs are needed. Prior to areaDetector
   R1-9 the ImageJ plugin used the standard Java mechanism for setting
   the EPICS Channel Access settings using a ``JCALibrary.properties`` file.
   This was often confusing because it uses a different mechanism than
   all C-based Channel Access clients, and because multiple
   JCALibrary.Properties files might be found in the Java search path,
   making it hard to figure out where a setting was coming from.
   Starting with areaDetector R1-9 the ImageJ plugin uses the same EPICS
   environment variables as Channel Access clients that use the C
   Channel Access library. Note that for EPICS_AD_Viewer the environment
   variable ``EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES`` almost always needs to be set,
   because the default value of 16KB is rarely large enough for images.
   ``EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES`` must be at least as large as the largest
   image size in bytes that you want to display. However, it is
   important not to set ``EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES`` to an unnecessarily
   large value like 100 MB, because the EPICS CA library allocates
   buffers of size ``EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES`` whenever the required buffer
   size is larger than 16KB. Remember also that ``EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES``
   must be set for both the IOC process and for the ImageJ client
   process. When using the V4 EPICS_NTNDA_Viewer it is not necessary to
   set ``EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES`` on either the ImageJ client or the IOC
   processes.
-  Start ImageJ and go to the ``Plugins/EPICS_areaDetector/EPICS_AD_Viewer``
   or EPICS_NTNDA_Viewer to run the plugin.
-  For the EPICS_AD_Viewer type in PV prefix for the NDStdArrays plugin
   for the detector to be viewed (e.g. 13SIM1:image1:).
-  For the EPICS_NTNDA_Viewer type in the PV name for the NDPluginPva
   plugin for the detector to be viewed (e.g. 13SIM1:Pva1:Image).
-  The background color of the PV prefix or PV name will change to green
   and you should see message saying that the PVs have connected. If you
   don't the most likely problem is a firewall.
-  Press the Start button to begin displaying images.

The control windows for EPICS_AD_Viewer and EPICS_NTNDA_Viewer are shown
below. The array dimensions and the number of frames per second actually
being displayed by ImageJ is shown. There is a status window that shows
whether the EPICS PVs are connected and the number of arrays received
since the last update, which is every 2 seconds.

Press the Snap button to make a copy of the current frame in a new
window. ImageJ can then be used to process, annotate, etc. that image.

To capture a sequence of images into an ImageJ "stack" select "Capture
To Stack". The image sequence will be stored in the ImageJ buffer and a
scroll bar will appear to allow you to scroll through the images. The
stack can be saved to disk in a large number of formats, including AVI.

Note that beginning with ADCore R2-6 the plugins automatically resets
the image image brightness and contrast when creating a new window. This
will often provide a reasonable values. To optimize the brightness and
contrast use the Image/Adjust/Brightness/Control menu in ImageJ. The
keyboard shortcut for this is Control+Shift+C, which is worth
remembering. Opening the Brightness and Contrast window will first do an
autoscaling, which is often quite good. Pressing the Auto button
repeatedly will step through several brightness/contrast settings.

The following is the main ImageJ window.

The following is a screen shot when using the EPICS_NTNDA_Viewer to
display compressed NTNDArrays. The source is the simDetector running on
a Linux machine, generating 1024x1024 UInt8 images at about 95 frames/s.
This is about 95MB/s or 760 Mb/s. The NDPluginCodec is compressing using
the Blosc ZSTD compressor with compression level=5 and Bit shuffle.
Actually Bit shuffle does nothing in 8-bit mode, so this could also be
None. There are 6 Blosc threads. The compression factor is 151, i.e. the
output arrays are 151 times smaller than the uncompressed arrays. The
Codec output goes to the NDPluginPva plugin which serves the NTNDArrays
on the network. The ImageJ viewer is running on a Windows machine and is
decompressing the arrays and displaying them at the full 95 frames/s
rate. The Windows Task Manager Network Monitor shows that the actual
network utilization is only 6.5 Mb/s, compared to over 760 Mb/s if we
were transmitting uncompressed arrays. The Windows machine has 8 cores,
and ImageJ is using approximately 1 core to decompress the arrays and
update the display at 95 frames/s.

ImageJ Controller (EPICS_AD_Controller.java)
--------------------------------------------

This is an ImageJ plugin which can be used to graphically control the
following:

-  The readout region of the detector or camera.
-  The size and position of an ROI (NDPluginROI).
-  The size and position of an overlay (NDPluginOverlay).

Normally this plugin will be used together with the EPICS_AD_Viewer
plugin described above. However, that is not required. For example, the
ImageJ window used with EPICS_AD_Controller could be a window read from
a TIFF file that the detector previously wrote.

The detector and plugin chain can include any of the following elements
and settings:

-  Camera/detector (MinX, MinY, SizeX, SizeY, BinX, BinY, ReverseX,
   ReverseY)
-  Transform plugin (NDPluginTransform) (Type, i.e. the transform
   operation None, Rot90, Mirror, etc.)
-  ROI plugin (NDPluginROI) (MinX, MinY, SizeX, SizeY, BinX, BinY,
   ReverseX, ReverseY))
-  Overlay plugin (NDPluginOverlay)
-  NDPluginStdArrays plugin (used by EPICS_AD_Viewer to get images)

All of the above components are optional, they do not need to be
present. However, the components that are present must be in the above
order in the "viewing" plugin chain. In other words the Transform plugin
must come before the ROI and Overlay plugins, and the ROI plugin must
come before the Overlay plugin. For the Transform and ROI plugins there
is a flag that allows selecting whether or not this plugin is included
the plugin chain. Note that this flag does not control the plugin chain,
rather it must be set to correctly reflect the actual setting of the
plugin chain. It is possible to use EPICS_AD_Control to control the ROI
without the ROI plugin being in the plugin chain. In fact this is a
common use case.

The following is the EPICS_AD_Controller plugin control, located in the
ImageJ "Plugins/EPICS_areaDetector/EPICS AD Controller" menu.

.. figure:: ImageJ_EPICS_AD_Controller.png
    :align: center

    ImageJ EPICS_AD_Controller plugin control window

The following are the controls on the EPICS_AD_Controller screen:

-  String input controls for the EPICS PV prefixes for the Camera,
   Transform plugin, ROI plugin, and Overlay plugin.
-  "Output PVs" combo box control that selects which component will be
   defined when the Set button is pushed. Choices are "Camera", "ROI",
   and "Overlay".
-  "Set" control button. Pressing this button calculates the coordinates
   of the component to be defined and writes the values to the desired
   PVs.
-  "Reset camera region" control button. Pressing this button resets the
   MinX and MinY of the camera to 0 and sets SizeX and SizeY to the
   maximum image size (MaxSizeX, MaxSizeY). Note that it does not modify
   the camera BinX, BinY, ReverseX, or ReverseY.
-  "Reset ROI" control button. Pressing this button resets the MinX and
   MinY of the ROI to 0 and sets SizeX and SizeY to the maximum camera
   image size (MaxSizeX, MaxSizeY). Note that it does not modify the ROI
   BinX, BinY, ReverseX, or ReverseY.
-  "Transform Plugin In Chain" checkbox. Check this box if the Transform
   plugin is part of the viewing plugin chain.
-  "ROI Plugin In Chain" checkbox. Check this box if the ROI plugin is
   part of the viewing plugin chain. Note that EPICS_AD_Controller can
   define the ROI even if it is not part of the viewing plugin chain,
   and in fact this is a common use case.
-  Status text box. Errors and informational messages are displayed
   here.

When using EPICS_AD_Controller to define the camera readout region then
the following rule must be followed. If the ROI plugin is in the viewing
chain then it must first be set to pass the entire image, i.e. MinX and
MinY must be 0, and SizeX and SizeY must be at least as large as the
image from the camera. This can be conveniently done by pressing the
"Reset ROI" button before defining the ImageJ ROI to select the camera
readout region. This is not required if the ROI is not in the viewing
plugin chain.

The following is the EPICS_AD_Viewer image display window with an
ellipse overlay that was defined using an ImageJ rectangular ROI and
EPICS_AD_Controller.

    rectangular Image ROI defining an elliptical overlay NDPluginOverlay

The EPICS_AD_Control plugin must be compiled in the same manner
described for EPICS_AD_Viewer above.

.. _ImageJGaussianProfiler:

ImageJ Gaussian Profiler (GaussianProfiler.java)
------------------------------------------------

This is an ImageJ plugin which can be used to dynamically plot a line
profile, fit the profile to a Gaussian peak, and print the fit
parameters (centroid, amplitude, full-width half-maximum (FWHM), and
background. It should be compiled in the same manner as EPICS_AD_Viewer
described above. It is used by drawing a line or rectangle in ImageJ and
then starting Plugins/EPICS_areaDetector/Gaussian Profiler.

The following is the GaussianProfiler window plotting the profile of the
peak shown above in the EPICS_AD_Controller image.

IDL Viewer
----------

There is an IDL procedure called
`epics_ad_display <https://cars.uchicago.edu/software/idl/imaging_routines.html#epics_ad_display>`__
that can be used to display 2-dimensional array data that the
:doc:`../ADCore/NDPluginStdArrays` sends to EPICS. This IDL
client is available as source code (which requires an IDL license), and
also as a pre-built IDL .sav file that can be run for free under the IDL
Virtual Machine. This IDL program can run on any machine that IDL runs
on, and that has the ezcaIDL shareable library built for it. This
includes Windows, Linux, Solaris, and Mac. ``epics_ad_display`` is
included in the `CARS IDL imaging
software. <https://cars.uchicago.edu/software/IDL/imaging.html>`__ It is
also available in the Viewers/IDL directory in the areaDetector
application.

The Viewers/IDL directory contains both the IDL source code and a
standalone IDL file, epics_ad_display.sav, for the epics_ad_display GUI
to display images from areaDetector detectors. This file can be run for
free on any Linux or Windows system under the IDL Virtual Machine, which
can be downloaded free of charge from `ITT
VIS <http://www.ittvis.com/idl>`__. That directory also contains the
shareable libraries used to call EPICS Channel Access from IDL
(ezcaIDL.dll for Windows and libezcaIDL.so for Linux). Before using the
IDL source code or .sav file it is necessary to define the environment
variable EZCA_IDL_SHARE to point to the complete path to ezcaIDL.dll or
libezcaIDL.so. For example on Linux:

::

   setenv EZCA_IDL_SHARE /home/epics/support/areaDetector/1-5/Viewers/IDL/libezcaIDL.so
     

On Windows use

::

   My Computer/Properties/Advanced/Environment Variables/ 
     

to add a new environment variable EZCA_IDL_SHARE to point to the
location of ezcaIDL.dll on your system. To run the standalone IDL
epics_ad_display.sav file without an IDL license execute the following
on Linux:

::

   idl -32 -vm=epics_ad_display.sav 
     

On Windows simply double-click on the icon for the epics_ad_display.sav
file.

When the GUI comes up type the base PV name for the NDStdArrays plugin
for your detector in the "Base PV" widget. For example with the
simulation detector supplied with the areaDetector application this is
"13SIM1:image1:" (without the quotes). Once the detector begins
acquiring images they should be displayed in the IDL window.

To run the GUI from the IDL command line on a system with an IDL license
type the epics_ad_display command followed by the base PV name of the
NDStdArrays plugin. For example:

::

     IDL> epics_ad_display, '13SIM1:image1:'
     

The control window for ``epics_ad_display`` is shown below. It has a
field to input the base name of the EPICS PVs with the image data. It
also has fields to enable/display the IDL display update, to change the
display mode, to autoscale the intensity, and to invert the image in the
Y direction. If autoscale is set to No then manual scaling can be
entered in the Min and Max fields. The number of frames per second
actually being displayed by IDL is shown. There is a status window that
shows whether the EPICS PVs are connected and the time the last was
array received, updated once per second.

.. figure:: IDL_epics_ad_display.png
    :align: center

    Main window for IDL epics_ad_display

``epics_ad_display`` can use the simple IDL routine ``tv`` to display
the images. This is the fastest mode, and results in a non-scalable
unadorned window.

.. figure:: IDL_epics_ad_display_tv.jpg
    :align: center

``epics_ad_display`` can also use the routine
`image_display.pro <https://cars.uchicago.edu/software/IDL/imaging_routines.html#IMAGE_DISPLAY>`__
to display the images. This routine displays row and column profiles as
the cursor is moved. It allows changing the color lookup tables, and
zooming in (right mouse click) and out (left mouse click). Note that
image_display is not currently capable of displaying color data i.e.,
RGB1, RGB2, or RGB3 NDArrays). It can however, display Mono data in
false color. The following is an example of ``image_display`` displaying
an image from the simulation detector.

The Viewers/IDL directory also contains an IDL function to read the
areaDetector netCDF files. This is described in the :ref:`NDFileNetCDF`
documentation.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If the ImageJ or IDL viewer is not displaying new images as the detector
collects them check the following:

-  If other EPICS channel access clients (e.g. medm, caget) running on
   the same machine as the viewer **cannot** connect to the IOC then
   check the following:

   -  There may be a firewall blocking EPICS channel access either on
      the server (IOC) machine or the client (viewer) machine.
   -  The environment variable EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST may need to be set to
      allow the client to find the IOC if the IOC is not on the same
      subnet as the viewer or if other EPICS channel access settings do
      not have their default values.

-  If other EPICS channel access clients (e.g. medm, caget) running on
   the same machine as the viewer **can** connect to the IOC then check
   the following:

   -  The detector is actually collecting images, and the ArrayCallbacks
      PV is set to Enable.
   -  For EPICS_AD_Viewer or IDL the NDPluginStdArrays plugin (normally
      called image1:) has the EnableCallbacks PV set to Yes, and that
      the MinCallbackTime PV is not set too large.
   -  For EPICS_AD_Viewer or IDL the environment variable
      EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES is set to a value at least as large as
      the size of the arrays to be sent to the viewer. This environment
      variable must be set on the machine that the IOC is running on
      before the IOC is started. It must also be set on the machine that
      the ImageJ or IDL viewer is running on before ImageJ or IDL is
      started.
   -  For EPICS_NTNDA_Viewer the NDPluginPva plugin (normally called
      Pva1:) has the EnableCallbacks PV set to Yes, and that the
      MinCallbackTime PV is not set too large.
